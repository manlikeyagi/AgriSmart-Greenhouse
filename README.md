# AgriSmart-Greenhouse irrigation system 
AgriSmart is an integrated IoT solution designed to monitor and manage various environmental and operational aspects of a greenhouse farm. The project consists of three main systems: the Irrigation System, Weather Station, and Gas Analyzer. Each system is built using NodeMCU microcontrollers and a range of sensors and actuators to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth and operational efficiency.
To optimize plant development, increase greenhouse management, and guarantee security and safety, the goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, automated greenhouse management system using Internet of Things technology. The project consists of three main sections: a weather station, an irrigation system, and a gas analyzer. NodeMCU microcontrollers and the Blynk software are used to control each of the integrated sensors in each section.
Sensors are used in the irrigation system to monitor soil moisture levels to maximize water usage. A DHT11 sensor and three 5V fans are used to control the temperature and humidity in the greenhouse, creating the ideal conditions for plant growth. To further improve security, a buzzer and a PIR motion sensor are added. These devices can identify unwanted entry and notify the farmer. The weather station offers continuous environmental condition monitoring. To gather information on light intensity, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, it combines a light sensor, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and a rain sensor. Remote monitoring and control are made possible by this data, which is sent to the Blynk app and shown on an LCD panel. The MQ135 gas sensor is used by the gas analyzer, which focuses on air quality, to identify dangerous gases including ammonia and CO2. A NodeMCU microcontroller processes the sensor data and transmits it to the Blynk app for real-time monitoring, guaranteeing the safety of the greenhouse environment for both workers and plants.
